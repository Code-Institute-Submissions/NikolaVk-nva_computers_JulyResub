# NVA computers 

You can view the deployed site here. [link](http://nva-computers.herokuapp.com/)

NVA Computers or Nikola Vukomanovic Arnhem Computers is made, designed and deployed as a final project at Code Institute. I chose this specific webshop because I like tech and I always like looking at the newest tech arround. The design is based of Code Institutes 'Boutique Ado' project with me adding some extra functions. Also minor visual changes have been made like the addition of a footer and certain elements change the way a user can explore the site. Ofcourse the colors have been changed completly and my persomnal favorite is the added darkmode which works on every page and remains in darkmode even when you go to another page of the site. The site has been made usable for all mobile devices and pc's.

### Color Scheme

#### Lightmode
- For the lightmode I used mostly white for the background and a dark color for the letters. Except for the footer where I used the yellow-orange background and black letters. The white and dark combination
looks modern which fits the business. The added yellow on some parts was to add some contrast and because of the location on where the business is based. The colors almost that of the famous local 
football club. I only used a slightly darker tone of yellow than that of the club to make it more pleasent to read. 

- Color Test

- Color Palet

![Color palet lightmode](/readme_media/colors.png)

#### Darkmode
- As for the darkmode I used a dark gray as the background and white font for easy reading. The yellow elements mostly remained the same. Some buttons have been changed to match the yellow and a hover effect
of the same combination has been added other buttons.

#### Footer for mobile

- The mobile footer is just like the navbar different. You will find that the cattegries section has been removed. The reason being I didn't want the footer to be a mile long. The user on mobile can always use the navbar as it will follow you as you scroll down. All the other elements including the Mailchimp form are still there.

![Mobile Footer](/readme_media/footer-mobile.png)

#### All Products Page

- On the top right corner of the all products page there is a counter which counts how many products are on the page. This makes it easier for the admin to see how many products he or she has on theyr site.
- On the other side there is a sort by function. This can sort by price, rating, name and category. This makes things easier when trying to fine the best rated or cheapest items.
- The product cards contain the most basic infotmation which should be enough. This contains the product picture, price, rating and name.
- The admin of the page gets 2 additional buttons to the cards which are edit and remove. Edit will takw you to the editor of that product and remove will reemove the product.

![All Products Page](/readme_media/all-products.png)

#### Product Detail Page

- Here you will find all that there is to know about the product you clicked on. Things like specs, description as well as all the information present within the cards on the All Products page.

- Once selected how many products a user wants to add he or she can must press the add to bag button. After that that will be added to the bag. The user can than continue to Checkout or press the Keep Shopping button which takes you back to the All Products page.
- The rating per product is based on the Reviews a user leaves begind. If there if no review it will simply say No Rating and if someone leaves a Review with a Rating it will be counted up. The more Ratings the more the number will change, this is because the function behind this counts every rating and than takes an average which is then displayed.

## Information Architecture

### Business Model

I chose to use a B2C (Business to Customer) method. This store offers products of branded products. If this was a real world store there would be a list of every brand being sold.

### Business Flow

- The products are being bought from the manifacturers directly.
- The site also handles all orders from the store directly to the customer.

Arriving on the site as a first time user it should be obvious what the intention is of this site.

### Marketing

- There is a facebook page link inside the footer which leads the users to the Facebook business page. You can view that page [here](https://www.facebook.com/NVA-Computers-109270341834620/).
- In the footer there is also a [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) form where users can register to recieve news and offers.

If the facebook page has been taken down for not being a real business you can view the images beneath.

- The entirety of the page.

    ![Facebook homepage](/readme_media/facebookpage.png)

- Facebook business information

    ![Facebook information](/readme_media/facebookinfo.png)
