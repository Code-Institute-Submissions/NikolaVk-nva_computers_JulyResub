# NVA computers 

You can view the deployed site here. [link](http://nva-computers.herokuapp.com/)

NVA Computers or Nikola Vukomanovic Arnhem Computers is made, designed and deployed as a final project at Code Institute. I chose this specific webshop because I like tech and I always like looking at the newest tech arround. The design is based of Code Institutes 'Boutique Ado' project with me adding some extra functions. Also minor visual changes have been made like the addition of a footer and certain elements change the way a user can explore the site. Ofcourse the colors have been changed completly and my persomnal favorite is the added darkmode which works on every page and remains in darkmode even when you go to another page of the site. The site has been made usable for all mobile devices and pc's.

### Color Scheme

#### Lightmode
    For the lightmode I used mostly white for the background and a dark color for the letters. Except for the footer where I used the yellow-orange background and black letters. The white and dark combination
    looks modern which fits the business. The added yellow on some parts was to add some contrast and because of the location on where the business is based. The colors almost that of the famous local 
    football club. I only used a slightly darker tone of yellow than that of the club to make it more pleasent to read.

#### Darkmode
    As for the darkmode I used a dark gray as the background and white font for easy reading. The yellow elements mostly remained the same. Some buttons have been changed to match the yellow and a hover effect
    of the same combination has been added other buttons.
