NVA Computers or Nikola Vukomanovic Arnhem Computers is made, designed and deployed as a final project at Code Institute. I chose this specific webshop because I like tech and I always like looking at the newest tech arround. The design is based of Code Institutes 'Boutique Ado' project with me adding some extra functions. Also minor visual changes have been made like the addition of a footer and certain elements change the way a user can explore the site. Ofcourse the colors have been changed completly and my persomnal favorite is the added darkmode which works on every page and remains in darkmode even when you go to another page of the site. The site has been made usable for all mobile devices and pc's.
