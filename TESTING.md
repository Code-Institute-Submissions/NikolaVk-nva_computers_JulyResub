## Automated Testing

### HTML

- The HTML code was tested using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). I tested every single page using view page source for every page. 
All pages pass the test widouth Errors or Warnings.

### CSS

- The CSS code was tested using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Just as the html code it passed all tests. I used direct input
to test the code. The code passed all tests widouth Errors.

### JS

- The JavaScript was tested using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) All scripts and js files passed that test.

### Python

- The Python code was tested using [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/). I tested every Python file and removed all Errors I found.
